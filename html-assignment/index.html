            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Jacob Shaw, and this is my webpage! I am 21 years old and I was born on March 26<sup>th</sup>, 2000. My home town is Chatham Ontario, and I am currently living in Ottawa at Algonquin College Residence for schooling. I was previously in the Computer Engineering program at Algonquin College, however I realized that the program was not for me, so I ended up switching over to the Interactive Media Design program!

                My interests include Video Games, Music, Movies and TV, as well as reading. My favorite author is <em> <abbr title="Howard Phillips">H.P.</abbr> Lovecraft</em>, and my favorite movie genre is horror. I own a ukulele that I am able to play, as well as a portable record player, as I am starting a vinyl record collection of my favorite albums. Currently, I am also listening to the entire discography of Kanye West in chronological order, listening to a new album every day, and plan to do this with more artists in the future.
